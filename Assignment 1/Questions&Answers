In this assignment we will come up with initial design for a software application that you will build in this semester. 
We will not be writing any code in this assignment, but only looking at some initial design ideas and high level architecture.

Description: 
A partner of your company has requested to build a software application that will predict the rate of the fuel based on the following criteria:
- Client Location (in-state or out-of-state)
- Client history (existing customer with previous purchase or new)
- Gallons requested
- Company profit margin (%)

Software must include following components:
- Login (Allow Client to register if not a client yet)
- Client Registration (Initially only username and Password)
- Client Profile Management (after client registers they should login first to complete profile)
- Fuel Quote Form with Pricing module (Once user enters all required information pricing module calculates the rate provides total cost)
- Fuel Quote History

Answer these questions:

1. Discuss your initial thoughts in details on how you will design this application? (2 points)
2. Discuss what development methodology you will use and why? (2 points)
3. Provide high level design / architecture of your solution that you are proposing? (6 points)
