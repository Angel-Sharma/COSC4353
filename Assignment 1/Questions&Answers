In this assignment we will come up with initial design for a software application that you will build in this semester. 
We will not be writing any code in this assignment, but only looking at some initial design ideas and high level architecture.

Description: 
A partner of your company has requested to build a software application that will predict the rate of the fuel based on the following criteria:
- Client Location (in-state or out-of-state)
- Client history (existing customer with previous purchase or new)
- Gallons requested
- Company profit margin (%)

Software must include following components:
- Login (Allow Client to register if not a client yet)
- Client Registration (Initially only username and Password)
- Client Profile Management (after client registers they should login first to complete profile)
- Fuel Quote Form with Pricing module (Once user enters all required information pricing module calculates the rate provides total cost)
- Fuel Quote History

Answer these questions:

1. Discuss your initial thoughts in details on how you will design this application? (2 points)

I think we should design this based on easist/ fastest.
Meaning we do
    1st: Set up base page to build modules off of aka index.js
    2nd: Login Page
    3rd: Registration Page
    4th: Profile Management Page
    5th: The last two should be further split up into smaller parts when we get to them so they can be tackled properly
        - Fuel Quote Form with Pricing module (Once user enters all required information pricing module calculates the rate provides total cost)
        - Fuel Quote History
I also think we should use HTML,JS,CSS,React for front end, something for backend?, something as database?
im familar with post gres SQL for backend if thats needed and im sure we can figure out something in python for the backend portion/

2. Discuss what development methodology you will use and why? (2 points)
3. Provide high level design / architecture of your solution that you are proposing? (6 points)
